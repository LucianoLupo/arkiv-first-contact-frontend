# Go-To-Market Strategy: Three-Phase Customer Acquisition

## Strategic Overview

**Thesis:** Bottom-up adoption through free tier, but revenue from top-down enterprise sales.

**Customer Acquisition Phases:**
1. **Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Blockchains** - Land 1-2 L2s as anchor customers
2. **Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Protocols** - Scale to 20+ DeFi protocols using our indexing
3. **Phase 3 (Months 13-18): Traders & Degens** - Open floodgates to individual users and trading firms

**Why this order?**
- L2s create **platform effects** (their ecosystem becomes our TAM)
- Protocols validate **product-market fit** (real revenue, real usage)
- Traders/degens provide **scale and virality** (network effects, word-of-mouth)

---

## Phase 1: Blockchains (Months 1-6)

### Target Customer Profile

**Who:** New and emerging L2s, L3s, app-chains, and sovereign rollups

**Characteristics:**
- Launching in 2024-2025
- Venture-backed ($10M+ raised)
- Building ecosystem (need developer tools)
- Don't have native block explorer yet
- Marketing-focused (want differentiation)

**Decision makers:**
- Head of Developer Relations
- CTO / Head of Infrastructure
- CEO (for strategic partnerships)

**Why they're ideal first customers:**
1. **Need is immediate** - launching without indexing is a non-starter
2. **High willingness to pay** - well-funded, budgets for infrastructure
3. **Marketing megaphone** - they'll promote us to their ecosystem
4. **Ecosystem effects** - their developers become our users
5. **Reference customer** - one major L2 logo opens doors to all others

---

---

### Value Proposition for L2s

**The Pitch:**
> "You're building the most decentralized L2. But your block explorer runs on AWS and your analytics rely on The Graph's centralized servers. That's your weakest link.
>
> Launch with fully decentralized data infrastructure. Your users can query on-chain data directly from Arkiv - no central point of failure. Be the first chain where even the analytics are unstoppable."

**Key Benefits:**
1. **Marketing Differentiation**
   - "First truly decentralized L2 - even our data layer is on-chain"
   - PR opportunity (TechCrunch: "Base launches with decentralized indexing")
   - Conference talking point (ETHDenver, Devconnect)

2. **Ecosystem Growth**
   - Pre-built analytics for every protocol on their chain
   - Developers get indexing "for free" (included in ecosystem support)
   - Lower barrier to building (don't need to run own indexers)

3. **Regulatory Advantage**
   - Censorship resistance = regulatory compliance in hostile jurisdictions
   - No central entity to pressure for data censorship
   - Verifiable, immutable audit trail

4. **Technical Benefits**
   - Faster time-to-market (don't build indexing in-house)
   - Focus on core chain, not peripheral tooling
   - Open source components (community can fork and improve)

---

### Sales Strategy

#### Outreach Tactics

**1. Conference Sponsorships**
- **EthCC Paris** (July) - Side events, booth, speaking slot
- **ETHDenver** (Feb/Mar) - Hackathon sponsor, workshop
- **Devconnect** (Nov) - L2 summit attendance, networking
- **Token2049** (Sep) - L2 roundtables

**Budget:** $50k for 4 major conferences
**Expected:** 50+ qualified conversations, 10 serious prospects

---

**2. Direct Outreach (Founder-Led)**

**Month 1-2: Research & Warm Intros**
- Map decision makers at target L2s
- Find mutual connections (VCs, advisors, ecosystem partners)
- Craft personalized outreach (not spray-and-pray)

**Outreach Template (DM/Email):**
```
Subject: Decentralized indexing for [Chain Name]

Hey [Name],

Congrats on [recent milestone - mainnet launch, funding round, etc.].

Quick question: How are you handling blockchain indexing/analytics for [Chain]?

We're building Arkiv-powered decentralized indexing - basically The Graph, but data lives on a blockchain instead of AWS. One of the L2s we're talking to called it "the missing piece for true decentralization."

Would love 15min to show you what we're building. We're offering early partners co-development (you shape the product) + generous pilot terms.

Does [specific day/time] work?

[Your name]
P.S. - Working demo: [link to live dashboard]

---

## Phase 2: DeFi Protocols (Months 7-12)

### Target Customer Profile

**Who:** DeFi lending protocols, DEXs, staking platforms, yield optimizers

**Characteristics:**
- $10M+ TVL (serious projects, not meme coins)
- Active development team
- Need analytics for risk management / governance
- Currently using The Graph subgraphs or in-house indexers

- GMX (perps DEX)
- Pendle (yield trading)
- Morpho (lending optimizer)
- Prisma (liquid staking)

---

### Value Proposition for Protocols

**The Pitch:**
> "The Graph shut down their hosted service. You migrated to decentralized network. But you're still querying from centralized gateway servers that can go down or censor addresses.
>
> Store your protocol events directly on Arkiv. Your community can query them forever - even if your team disappears. True protocol immortality."

**Key Benefits:**

1. **Governance Legitimacy**
   - DAO can verify all data on-chain
   - No "trust the dashboard" - verify yourself
   - Immutable voting history, proposal data

2. **Risk Management Reliability**
   - Data available during black swan events (when you need it most)
   - No centralized API rate limits during liquidation cascades
   - Real-time monitoring that can't be shut down

3. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Censorship resistance = you can't be forced to hide data
   - Important for protocols facing regulatory scrutiny
   - Verifiable audit trail for compliance

4. **Community Empowerment**
   - Anyone can build dashboards on your data
   - Forkable analytics (community can maintain if you don't)
   - True public good (data outlives the company)

---

### Sales Strategy

#### Outreach Tactics

**1. Content Marketing (Protocol-Specific)**

**Create case studies:**
- "How Aave Could Use Decentralized Indexing for Risk Management"
- "The Cost of Centralized Analytics: What Protocols Risk"
- "Governance Data Integrity: Why Decentralization Matters"

**Publish on:**
- Mirror (crypto-native platform)
- Medium (broader reach)
- Protocol forums (Aave governance forum, Uniswap governance)
- Tweet threads with infographics

**Goal:** Inbound leads from protocols seeing the value prop

---

**2. Ecosystem Leverage (From Phase 1)**

**If we land Base as anchor customer:**
- Base has 50+ DeFi protocols in ecosystem
- We get warm intros to all of them
- Offer: "Free indexing for Base ecosystem protocols"

**Pitch:**
> "You're building on Base. Base uses us for chain-level indexing. We'll index your protocol for free (first 6 months) as part of the Base Ecosystem Program."

**Expected conversion:** 20-30% of Base ecosystem = 10-15 protocols

---

**3. Direct Outreach (SDR-Led, Founder-Supported)**

**Hire:** 1 SDR (Sales Development Rep) in Month 6
**Salary:** $60k base + $40k OTE (on-target earnings)
**Metrics:** 50 outreach/week, 10 meetings/week, 2 pilots/month

**Outreach Template:**
```
Subject: [Protocol] analytics without central servers

Hey [Protocol Lead],

I saw you recently migrated from The Graph's hosted service to the decentralized network.

That's great, but you're still querying through centralized gateway servers (poke.trythe.io runs on AWS).

We built Arkiv-based indexing where the data itself lives on-chain. No central point of failure. No gateway servers.

[L2 Partner Name] uses us for their chain. [Protocol on that L2] uses us for their protocol.

Would love to show you a working Aave V3 dashboard we built - 100% queries from Arkiv blockchain.

15min call this week?

[Name]
```

## Phase 3: Traders & Degens (Months 13-18)

### Target Customer Profile

**Who:** Individual traders, MEV searchers, on-chain analysts, content creators, DeFi users

**Segments:**

1. **Professional Traders**
   - Day traders, swing traders
   - Need reliable price feeds
   - Current pain: API rate limits during volatility

2. **MEV Searchers**
   - Arbitrage bots, liquidation bots
   - Need low-latency event feeds
   - Current pain: Centralized APIs censor or delay data

3. **On-Chain Analysts**
   - Twitter influencers (Ember, Lookonchain)
   - Dune analysts building dashboards
   - Current pain: Dune is expensive, data not exportable

4. **DeFi Power Users**
   - Yield farmers, liquidity providers
   - Need portfolio tracking
   - Current pain: Centralized apps (Zapper, DeBank) track you

5. **Developers Building Tools**
   - Building portfolio trackers, alert bots, research tools
   - Current pain: API costs scale with users

---

### Value Proposition for Traders/Degens

**The Pitch (Different for Each Segment):**

**For Traders:**
> "Your bot got rate-limited and you missed the trade. Never again. Query blockchain data directly from Arkiv - no API keys, no rate limits (beyond blockchain speed), no downtime during volatility."

**For MEV Searchers:**
> "Centralized APIs can censor transactions or delay data. We can't. Query events that others might hide - sanctioned addresses, privacy protocols, alpha opportunities."

**For Analysts:**
> "Dune costs $400/month and you don't own your queries. We're $199/month and you can export everything. Oh, and the data can't be shut down."

**For DeFi Users:**
> "Zapper tracks your wallet. We don't. Query your own positions directly from the blockchain. Privacy-preserving portfolio tracking."

*(This exceeds our conservative $1.2M ARR target from Business Model doc - strong execution could yield 2x)*

---

## Key Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Can't Land L2 Anchor in Phase 1
**Impact:** Slower credibility, harder protocol sales

**Mitigation:**
- Pivot to protocols first (Aave already works, natural lead)
- Skip L2s, go direct to large protocols
- Use protocol logos to sell to L2s later (reverse order)

---

### Risk 2: Protocols Don't See Urgency
**Impact:** Long sales cycles, low conversion

**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize The Graph's shutdown (create urgency)
- Focus on risk/governance use cases (clear ROI)
- Offer free managed service for 6 months (remove friction)

---

### Risk 3: Free Users Don't Upgrade
**Impact:** High traffic, low revenue

**Mitigation:**
- Lower free tier limits (force upgrades faster)
- Add high-value Pro features (private dashboards, alerts)
- Upsell managed services (pay us to run indexers)

---

### Risk 4: Competition from The Graph
**Impact:** They copy us, leverage brand

**Mitigation:**
- Speed (land customers before they react)
- True decentralization (they can't match without rebuilding)
- Open source (community trust beats VC funding)

---

## The "Land & Expand" Playbook

**Land:** L2 as anchor (Phase 1)
**Expand 1:** L2's ecosystem protocols (Phase 2)
**Expand 2:** Protocols' users and traders (Phase 3)
**Expand 3:** Competing L2s (see Base using us, want same)

**Network effects at every layer:**
- More L2s → More protocols → More users → More data → More valuable
- More users → More dashboards → More templates → Easier to use → More users

**This is how we get to $100M ARR:**
Not by selling to 50,000 individuals.
By selling to 50 L2s × 100 protocols each × 10,000 users on each.

**Land 1 L2. Get 5,000 customers.**

That's the strategy.
